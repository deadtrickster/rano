//! Diffs: a line diff, an intra-line word diff, and a unified rendering.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Ported from letibot's `crates/ui/src/diff.rs`, which adapted the hunk model
//! from grok-build (xAI, Apache-2.0, `xai-grok-pager-diff`): `Row`,
//! `MAX_CONTEXT = 3`, overlapping-hunk stitching. The edit script, the hunks, the
//! word diff and the tab rule are letibot's, unchanged; what changed in the move is
//! the medium. letibot drew ANSI strings, and rano draws ratatui [`Line`]s — so a
//! row is spans with [`Style`]s that compose, a background survives the syntax
//! colour patched over it, and the wrap is rano's own cluster-aware
//! [`crate::width::segments`] rather than an escape-carrying string wrapper.
//!
//! # The algorithm, and the bound on it
//!
//! Myers' greedy O(ND) edit-script algorithm, with the two standard
//! preconditioners (strip the common prefix and suffix first) and one
//! non-standard guard: **`max_d`**. Myers is O(ND) where D is the size of the
//! edit script, so two unrelated 10,000-line files cost 10⁸ steps — and a frame
//! must not stall. Past `max_d` the diff gives up and reports the region as a
//! whole replacement, which is both honest and what a reader would conclude
//! anyway. [`Diff::degraded`] says when that happened, so it is never silent.
//!
//! # Word-level highlight, and where it stops
//!
//! Inside a hunk, a removed line adjacent to an added line is *usually* an edit
//! of that line, and showing which run of characters changed is the difference
//! between reading a diff and scanning it. The pairing rule is positional — the
//! k-th removal in a run pairs with the k-th addition — and is only attempted
//! when the two lines are similar enough ([`SIMILARITY_FLOOR`]), so two entirely
//! different lines are shown plainly rather than as a sea of emphasis.
//!
//! **That pairing is a consumer of an ordering guarantee, so the guarantee is
//! written down.** Within one changed region the algorithm lists every deletion
//! before every addition — [`diff_lines`] states it, `pair_rows` depends on it,
//! and `deletions_precede_additions_within_a_changed_region` pins it.
//!
//! # One number column, not two
//!
//! The unified view's gutter carries the line's number **in its own file**: the
//! old file's on a deletion and on a context row, the new file's on an addition.
//! Two columns — old beside new — leave one of them blank on every changed line,
//! exactly where the reader is looking. The split view ([`crate::sidediff`])
//! keeps two numbers, one per panel: two panels over two files are two files'
//! lines.
