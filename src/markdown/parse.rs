//! Incremental markdown: §13.3's other half, on tree-sitter.
//!
//! > **What not to do:** pi's `updateContent` calls `contentContainer.clear()` and
//! > rebuilds every child from the whole accumulated `message.content` on **every**
//! > `message_update`, i.e. once per delta — O(n²) over a message.
//!
//! The mechanism is a **window**: everything the model has written that has settled
//! into a complete block is frozen into `stable` and never shown to a parser again;
//! only the still-growing tail is parsed, per delta.
//!
//! # Why the window, and not tree-sitter's incremental re-parse
//!
//! The obvious design is to hand the whole growing document to one tree-sitter
//! parser and let it reuse the prefix. [`crate::syntax::Stream`] was built for exactly
//! that, and it was measured: **it does not work.** `ts_parser__can_reuse_first_leaf`
//! (`parser.c`) refuses to reuse a token when the current parse state admits external
//! tokens, and markdown's block grammar runs a 48-state external scanner in nearly
//! every block state — so a markdown push re-lexes essentially the whole document,
//! ~106 ns per document byte, about what a full parse costs. Measured: 829 µs at the
//! start of a 1,000-push stream, 9.5 ms at the end (11×), and 88.8 ms per push for the
//! two-pass pipeline. Linear per push means quadratic over the stream. The numbers and
//! the tree-sitter source behind them are in rano's `TODO.md` §9 and on `Stream`'s doc
//! comment.
//!
//! So the bound cannot come from the parser's reuse; it has to come from **not giving
//! the parser the settled text at all**. That is what this window is, and it is also
//! what the hand-written lexer this replaced did. `Stream` is still the
//! engine underneath — what changed is that it is fed a bounded window instead of an
//! unbounded document.
//!
//! # What settles, and what that costs
//!
//! A block settles when a *later* block starts after it: the parser has then seen the
//! text that could have changed its mind, so the next delta cannot. That is
//! tree-sitter's own reuse criterion, read off the tree instead of guessed from the
//! text, and it is strictly better than the four text guards this file used to carry
//! (it knows whether it is inside a fence, a list or a quote, because it parsed them).
//!
//! The one shape that never settles is a single block that keeps growing: one long
//! paragraph, and — because CommonMark makes a blank line between items one *loose*
//! list — one long bulleted answer. `max_unfrozen` bounds it: past that, the window is
//! cut at the last [`stable_boundary`] inside it, which is where the old text guards
//! survive. The cost of being wrong there is bounded and visible: two tight lists
//! render where one loose list was, a blank line's difference in a terminal. The cost
//! of the alternative is O(n²) on a 50 KB answer.
//!
//! # Instrumentation
//!
//! [`IncrementalMarkdown::bytes_lexed`] is kept in the shipping type rather than in a
//! test harness, because "is the renderer quadratic again" is a question that gets
//! asked once a year and is unanswerable after the fact. It counts the bytes handed to
//! a parser — the deltas, plus every window re-parse. A full re-parse per delta lexes
//! `O(n²)` bytes over a message; this lexes `O(n · window)`.

/// nothing to reuse; the cost being avoided is lexing megabytes to draw the bottom of a
/// 24-row window.
///
/// # What the tail is guaranteed to be
///
/// `lex(&src[cut..])` gives blocks whose **second and later** entries are the same blocks
/// the whole document ends with. The **first** may be ragged, and that is not a defect to
/// fix:
///
/// - a cut between two lines of one paragraph gives the tail a paragraph holding only the
///   lower lines, where the whole had one paragraph of both;
/// - a cut inside a loose list gives the tail a list that starts mid-way — and it renders
///   **identically**, because the renderer numbers from the marker the model wrote
///   (`start + i`), which is the same reason a loose list keeps its numbers.
///
/// So `[1..]` is the exact part and `[0]` is the price. A caller must therefore ask for
/// more than it draws — the ragged block goes off the top of the window, and everything
/// visible is exact. `a_tail_cut_is_exact_below_its_first_block` is that property, and it
/// is the reason `min_bytes` is a floor rather than a size.
