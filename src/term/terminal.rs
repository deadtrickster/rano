//! Raw mode, the alternate screen, the window size, reading input, and the row-diffing
//! painter.
//!
//! Ported from letibot's `crates/tui/src/backend/terminal.rs`; the comments are its, with
//! "the head" meaning whatever program draws through this — letibot's TUI, and rano's editor
//! once it is off crossterm. [`Terminal::draw_buffer`] is the new entry: a
//! [`crate::render::Buffer`] emitted under a palette and painted as rows.
//!
//! Fifty lines of `termios` instead of a TUI framework, for the same reason
//! `letibot-turn` writes its own HTTP: what this needs is byte-level control of one
//! well-understood interface, and a framework brings an event loop that would then
//! be the second one in the process.
//!
//! # The restore is the whole risk
//!
//! A head that panics with the terminal in raw mode leaves the operator's shell
//! unusable. [`Terminal`] restores on `Drop`, and the panic hook installed by
//! [`Terminal::enter`] restores before the message is printed — otherwise the
//! backtrace prints as a staircase and the shell has no echo.
//!
//! # The modes this file turns on, and what each one buys
//!
//! | sequence | on enter | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `?1049h` | alternate screen | the head owns the screen and gives it back |
//! | `?25l` / `?25h` | cursor | parked on the composer by [`Terminal::draw_with_cursor`] |
//! | `?2004h` | bracketed paste | a paste arrives as **one** [`Event::Paste`] |
//! | `\x1b[2 q` | steady block cursor | the composer's only affordance is the caret |
//! | `?2026h` / `?2026l` | synchronised output | see below |
//!
//! **DEC 2026 (synchronised output)** wraps every frame the head emits. A frame is
//! a sequence of absolute cursor moves and erases; without it a terminal is free
//! to present the screen halfway through one, which is a torn frame — and a torn
//! frame at 10 Hz is exactly what "flicker" describes. Terminals that do not know
//! the mode ignore the private sequence, so it costs eight bytes per frame that
//! writes anything and nothing at all on an idle one.
//!
//! # Counting what was written, because a capture cannot
//!
//! `tmux capture-pane` shows the *rendered* pane, so it can say what the screen
//! ended up looking like and never how much was written to get there — and
//! "how much of the glass did that redraw" is the question a lost mouse
//! selection asks, since a terminal's selection is over drawn cells. So the
//! write path counts itself: [`WriteStats`], reported on restore when
//! `RANO_WRITE_STATS` names a file (or `-` for stderr). letibot's name for it,
//! `LETIBOT_TUI_WRITE_STATS`, is read when the new one is unset.
//!
//! ```text
//! RANO_WRITE_STATS=/tmp/before letibot-tui --replay session.jsonl
//! ```
//!
//! # Reading is not a single fixed-size read
//!
//! It was: one 64-byte buffer, decoded, and anything that did not fit was the
//! next read's problem — except a read that ends **mid-UTF-8** failed
//! `from_utf8` and was dropped on the floor, silently. Pasting a stack trace
//! into the composer lost bytes. [`Terminal::events`] now loops while the buffer
//! keeps filling or a bracketed paste is still open, and carries an incomplete
//! tail — a partial UTF-8 sequence, a half-arrived escape, an unterminated paste
//! — into the next read instead of discarding it.
